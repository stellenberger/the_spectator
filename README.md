This is the tech test for The Spectator. 

I have decided to do this technical test in React as I am familiar with it, the setup is relatively simple and the app will be easier to scale if further development is needed. 

To use this app, first download dependencies: 

```
$ npm install 
```

Then run the app using npm start

```
$ npm start
```

To run the tests, use 

```
$ npm test
```
