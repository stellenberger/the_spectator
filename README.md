This is the tech test for The Spectator. The aim is to reproduce their site to the best of my ability. Here is a link: https://www.spectator.co.uk/

I have decided to do this technical test in React as I am familiar with it, the setup is relatively simple and the app will be easier to scale if further development is needed. 

To use this app, first download dependencies: 

```
$ npm install 
```

Then run the app using npm start

```
$ npm start
```

To run the tests, use 

```
$ npm test
```
